        	The OP-1 mini synthesizer from Teenage Engineering is one of the most stand out products of it’s class. At just 28 x 10cm it is a condensed powerhouse for the beginner level and casual music production enthusiasts. For those more versed in the art, it acts as a mobile machine that allows you to create beats, mix audio, synthesize, and even sample on the go. The genius of the OP-1 is its various programs similar to those you would find on programs like FL Studio or LMMS. While OP-1 generally won’t produce the clean sounds you can get through those programs it offers a great standalone alternative for those who can’t afford or don’t want a bulky computer set up. The OP-1 definitely has it falls, in that it’s implantation has a midi keyboard leaves some to be desired, and Teenage Engineering leaves a lot of the learning up to you. It more then makes up for these shortcomings in it’s versatile use, its mobility, and the real attention-grabber; it’s tape recorder function allowing you to sample sounds out in the world.

          Only on day 1, but this thing is awesome. I had to run a firmware update, which went super smooth - the main catch is you have to get the manual from the developer's web site. There is literally no book or instructions other than an overlay vinyl cheat sheet with the device. On their site they only show you one topic at a time with no way to print the entire manual - luckily there is a support forum where a user has done just that - was able to print out the 46 page manual which is actually very very detailed and well written. This thing is overwhelming at first, but once you understand the buttons/layout and potential functionality it starts to make sense! Very sturdy as others have mentioned (it's like a block of metal) and the screen is super sharp. I wouldn't do anything using the built in speaker - you really need headphones or some real speakers to output to... but in a pinch it's better than nothing!
          One Item I'm not too confident in is the ability to charge - mine looked like it was charging (buildup of green lights topped with a red) - i got a little excited and went and turned it on to try it out once it had a little charge - now the lights flash once, then never go into their charging animation. When I press the help button it only lights up one light (supposed to light them all up for a full charge). Anyway - if you look through their forums there are a ton of charging/battery related issues. It may be that the charge is full but the display won't share that information.. no idea where the issue is. Not a huge deal yet but for something this $$ you'd think something like battery charging would be a non-issue.
          The only real lack of usability I feel is with the knobs - if you don't spin them fast enough on the menu screens they won't start to scrub through the options, so i feel like I'm having to flail around a bit to get the functionality to catch and start responding (I wouldn't call it lag, it's just the way they set up the hardware talking to the software that's a bit funky.)

          After wanting to get this for ages, I decided to make the plunge.
          At first I had a bit of fun with it, then got frustrated (thinking I would always be terrible at it) and put it aside in favor of a guitar (thinking I was going to return it) and just used it basically as an expensive drum machine, but then after a bit more practice, I started to get a hang of it! Ever since then, it's been my go to for making creative music! It's actually been the base for most of the music that I've made since getting a hang of it (and the root of most improve that I do with friends).
          Long story short, give it time, I think you might like it.

          Some of the best fun I've ever had in my life with this little thing. Amazing. But you probably already know that. Like other Teenage Engineering synths I have, this thing is built like a tank, and the battery lasts for literally hours.
